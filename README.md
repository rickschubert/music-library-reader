This project has been created for the website https://www.greatamericansongbook.info/ .

The tool can be downloaded [under the releases page](https://github.com/rickschubert/music-library-reader/releases). Simply download the tool and then execute it - it will then walk you through all the required steps. (Please note that this build is for Windows as this is the operating system used by greatamericansongbook.info. Executables for other OS's can be built as well though, no problem.)
